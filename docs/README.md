# greeter

Greet visitors to your website using their heart language and the time of day with this tiny VanillaJS script ðŸŒŽ

## Usage

Include the script in your website, either using `yarn` or `npm` (coming soon!), or with a `script` tag. We recommend at the bottom of the page `body`, like:

```html
 <script src="greeter.js"></script> 
```

Then, add a default greeting to your page, like "Hello!":

```html
<p><span id="greeting">Hello!</span>Welcome to my website!</p>
```

The page will load, and change from the hard-coded default greeting, to the heart-language of the user.

## How can I get involved?

I welcome PRs to support more languages (I'd love to include all language codes!), regionally-specific greetings, and spelling, grammatical and cultural improvements to the langauge.
